Language Families

This Java project can help us build a model to track inherited traits across language families. In this case, we’ll focus on something that often varies between language families: word order — where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

For example, in English, you would use subject-verb-object order:

She	eats	noodles

But in Japanese, you would use subject-object-verb order:

彼女は	麺を	食べる
(she)	(noodles)	(eats)
